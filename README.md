# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
The image dataset is given and the model must denoise the images and show it with better quality and remove the unwanted noises and learn to show the better version of the images.
## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:

Download and split the dataset into training and testing datasets.

### STEP 2:

Rescale the data so that the training is made easier.

### STEP 3:

We create two networks , one for encoding and one for decoding







## PROGRAM:
```python

```



## OUTPUT:

### Training Loss, Validation Loss Vs Iteration Plot:



### Original vs Noisy Vs Reconstructed Image:





## RESULT:
